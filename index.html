<p>It's the fourth book in the "Monsters of Ed-Tech" series &#8211; a sequel to my 2014 book <em><a href="http://monsters.hackeducation.com">The Monsters of Education Technology</a></em> and to my 2015 book <em><a href="http://monsters2.hackeducation.com">The Revenge of the Monsters of Education Technology</a></em> and to my 2016 book <em><a href="http://monsters3.hackeducation.com">The Curse of the Monsters of Education Technology</a></em>.

<p>Publication date: Halloween 2017</p>

<p>It's the fourth (and likely final) book in the "Monsters of Ed-Tech" series &#8211; a sequel to my 2014 book <em><a href="http://monsters.hackeducation.com">The Monsters of Education Technology</a></em> and to my 2015 book <em><a href="http://monsters2.hackeducation.com">The Revenge of the Monsters of Education Technology</a></em> and to my 2016 book <em><a href="http://monsters3.hackeducation.com">The Curse of the Monsters of Education Technology</a></em>.

<p>E-book versions are available for purchase via the usual online retailers: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0771NM7R4">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/756386">Smashwords</a>. Even better (as far as my cut goes): you can buy from me directly <a href="https://gumroad.com/products/jBVJX/">via Gumroad</a>. You can purchase the e-book there (a ZIP file that contains the MOBI, EPUB, and PDF versions) for $4.99.</p>

<p>A print and audio version of the book will be available some day.</p>
